        <p>At KidsCanCode we make computers fun!  By looking "under the hood," kids learn that a computer is a powerful tool - one they can use to create amazing projects of their own.  Imagine building your own website, creating a video game, or wow-ing your teacher with an amazing science project.  Our classes lay the foundation for a positive relationship with technology.</p>
        <p>Classes are available for a variety of ages and experience levels.</p>

            </dt>
            <dd><p>This is our core program, introducing the idea of a programming language and what it means to tell a computer what to do.  We'll cover basic interaction with the Python console using statements to manipulate numbers and text.  Next, we'll move on to Turtles - creating our own graphics and introducing loops and functions.  Finally, we'll create some games and animations to round out the week.<br>
            Throughout the class, students will learn not just the code, but the *why* behind the code, setting a strong foundation for future growth.

            <dd><p>Minecraft is one of the hottest games on the market - and best of all, it's all about creativity.  Whether your child is a complete newbie or a Minecrafting expert, this class will have something new to offer.  Using the special educational <a href="http://pi.minecraft.net/">Minecraft: Pi Edition</a>, we'll explore how to control the Minecraft world through code.  We'll brainstorm to ideas of things to build, and show off our own creations on the last day of class.  And the fun doesn't stop there: after class ends, every student will have the opportunity to bring his/her Raspberry Pi home to continue the Minecraft adventure!  Raspberry Pi kits will be available for $75.<br> -->

                Are you ready for the next level?  We take what kids learned in "Intro to Programming" and build on it. Using the <a href="http://pygame.org/">Pygame framework</a> we'll explore the game development process from beginning to end.  What makes a game fun?  How do you test your game?  What about art and sound?  Each student will be encouraged to get creative and make something truly their own.<br>
                Building a game is a challenging project, incorporating problem solving, planning, math, art, and design.  Taught by a game industry veteran, our class will show kids a real-world perspective on what it takes to bring their vision to life.<br><br>

                This class was specifically created for younger students who aren't quite ready for all the typing that "regular" programming entails, but really want to get started learning to code!  Using the Scratch language from MIT, students will drag-and-drop "program blocks" to build up instructions - allowing them to focus more on their goals than on hunting for the right key.<br>
                Through the course of the week, they'll create animations, interactive stories, and games to challenge their friends (and parents).  And best of all, every child will be able to bring his/her creations home to share (we'll help Mom & Dad with instructions for using Scratch at home).<br>
