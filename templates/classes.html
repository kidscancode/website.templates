        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>At KidsCanCode we make computers fun!  By looking "under the hood," kids learn that a computer is a powerful tool - one they can use to create amazing projects of their own.  Imagine building your own website, creating a video game, or wow-ing your teacher with an amazing science project.  Our classes lay the foundation for a positive relationship with technology.</p>
        <p>All classes are available for ages 10-14. </p>
        <div class="alert alert-success"><strong>UPDATE</strong> - Summer sessions will be held at the Sherman Oaks Galleria community room (<a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&q=Sherman+Oaks+Galleria+-+Community+Room" target="_blank">map</a>).

            <dt>Introduction to<br>Programming</dt>
            <dd><p>This is our core program, introducing the idea of a programming language and what it means to tell a computer what to do.  We'll cover basic interaction with the Python console using statements to manipulate numbers and text.  Next, we'll move on to Turtles - creating our own graphics and introducing loops and functions.  Finally, we'll conclude with covering the workings of the Raspberry Pi - how to set it up at home, and what can be done with it.<br>
            <strong>NOTE: </strong>Tuition includes the Raspberry Pi kit, which will be used for all class activities, and the child will take home at the end of the session!<br>

            <dt>Programming with<br> Minecraft</dt>
            <dd><p>Minecraft is one of the hottest games on the market - and best of all, it's all about creativity.  Whether your child is a complete newbie or a Minecrafting expert, this class will have something new to offer.  Using the special educational <a href="http://pi.minecraft.net/">Minecraft: Pi Edition</a>, we'll explore how to control the Minecraft world through code.  We'll brainstorm to ideas of things to build, and show off our own creations on the last day of class.  And the fun doesn't stop there: after class ends, every student will be able to bring his/her Raspberry Pi home to continue the Minecraft adventure!<br>
            Learn how to:
            <ul>
                <li>Create complex structures in only a few lines of code</li>
                <li>Build objects that move!</li>
                <li>Import 3d models from the web</li>
            </ul>

                Are you ready for the next level?  We take what kids learned in "Introduction to Programming" and build on it.  We introduce the concept of objects and use that to create our very first game!  Using the <a href="http://pygame.org/">Pygame framework</a> we'll build a game from beginning to end.  Then each child will be encouraged to get creative by modifying the game we've created into something uniquely their own.<br><br>

            <dd><p><span class="badge badge-success">Coming soon</span><br>
                So you have a Raspberry Pi - now what?<br>
                This class is all about the power of the <a href="aboutpi.html">Raspberry Pi</a>.  It's not only a great general purpose computing platform, it's also a great way to learn about electronics and foster a do-it-yourself mentality.  We'll cover the basics of Linux (the operating system of the Pi), experiment with its capabilities, and create our own circuits to control LEDs and sensors via Python programs.<br><br>
