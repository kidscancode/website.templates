<p>The <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> is a credit-card sized computer developed to promote teaching of computer science in schools.  Since its launch in 2012, over 1 million of these amazing little machines have been sold all over the world.  It also includes an interface for talking to external analog/digital electronics, so it also makes a great platform for DIY projects.</p>

<p>The Raspberry Pi comes with the Scratch and Python programming languages already installed, so it's ready to go out of the box - just plug in a monitor and keyboard/mouse!</p>

<p>Here are just a few examples of projects kids can make with a Pi:</p>

<ul>
<li>Programming</li>
<li>Web development</li>
<li>Electronics</li>
<li>Robotics</li>
<li>Automation/Sensing</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-raspberry-pi">How do we use the Raspberry Pi?</h2>
<p>At KidsCanCode, we have built on the educational foundations of the Raspberry Pi to create a customized learning environment.  But it's not just
    about learning - it's about putting the tools into the hands of kids and enabling them to take the next step.<br>
Our Raspberry Pi Kits include everything you need to get started:
<ul>
    <li>Raspberry Pi (Model B)</li>
    <li>8 Gb SD card - preloaded with class content, code, and help files</li>
    <li>Power cable</li>
    <li>A plastic case to hold the Pi</li>
</ul>
