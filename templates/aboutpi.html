<p>The <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> is a credit-card sized computer developed to promote teaching of computer science in schools.  Since its launch in 2012, over 1 million of these amazing little machines have been sold all over the world.  It also includes an interface for talking to external analog/digital electronics, so it also makes a great platform for DIY projects.</p>

<p>The Raspberry Pi comes with the Scratch and Python programming languages already installed, so it's ready to go out of the box - just plug in a monitor and keyboard/mouse!</p>

<p>Here are just a few examples of projects kids can make with a Pi: </p>

<p>At KidsCanCode, we have built on the educational foundations of the Raspberry Pi to create a customized learning environment.  But it's not just
    about learning - it's about putting the tools into the hands of kids and enabling them to take the next step.<br>
Our Raspberry Pi Kits are included with each course fee and have everything you need to get started:
