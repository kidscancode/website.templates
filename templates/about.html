<p>KidsCanCode.org was created in 2013 by Chris and Priya Bradfield.  Being the parents of two girls, we are very aware of what does and does not work in today's K-12 educational programs.  With the continued struggle for public funding, we've seen how hard it is to expose children to any curriculum outside of the standardized testing requirements.  We think that's a problem, especially when it comes to preparing the next generation of scientific and technology professionals.</p>

<p>Our goal is simply to teach children to code.  We believe that a basic understanding of software engineering provides a set of fundamental skills that is vital, both to the child's future and the future of the global economy.  It's not just about STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math), but also about liberal arts: being able to think critically about problems is the first step to finding solutions.  An early introduction to computer science is an investment in the future.</p>

<p>Girls are particularly underserved when it comes to computer science education.  While women earn 57% of all undergraduate degrees, they earn only 18% of those issued in computer and information sciences (<small>Source: <a href="http://www.todaysengineer.org/2013/Mar/gender-diversity.asp">IEEE</a></small>).  Why does this matter?  Computing and information technology are among the fastest growing US industries, yet by 2018, US universities will produce only 52% of the degrees needed to fill 1.4 million available jobs (<small>Source: <a href="http://www.bls.gov/ooh/About/Projections-Overview.htm#totaljobopenings">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a></small>).</p>

<p>We plan to hold special "girls only" classes, helping to remove the social pressure of gender competition, and bringing in professional women to speak directly to the challenges and benefits of working in technology.  We work with organizations like Girl Scouts to reach out to girls in the community.</p>
