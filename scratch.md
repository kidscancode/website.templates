We are surrounded by technology, and every single piece of technology, from your smartphone to the car you drive, is controlled by software that was written by programmers.  Learning about programming helps you learn about how computers work.

Learning programming skills, even at the elementary school level, can have numerous benefits:
* It teaches about problem solving (algorithmic thinking)
* It's cross-curricular (solve math problems or create an art project)
* It generates early interest in Computer Science
* It stimulates design & creativity
* It strengthens math skills

## Why Python?
Python is a fully featured modern programming language that places an emphasis on writing code that is easy to read.  As such, it has gained a strong following in educational circles as a first language for computer science courses.

A summary of Python's benefits:
* Multi-platform - runs on all popular computing platforms
* Wide global industry support - Python is used at YouTube, NASA, Google, and many more
* Clean and simple syntax
    * Lets students focus on learning skills such as decomposition, without struggling with complicated syntax
    * Python programs are easy to read
* General purpose - can be applied to many different types of problems
