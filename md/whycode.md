## Benefits of learning programming
We are surrounded by technology, and every single piece of technology, from your smartphone to the car you drive, is controlled by software that was written by programmers.  Learning about programming helps you learn about how computers work.

Learning programming skills, even at the elementary school level, can have numerous benefits:
* It teaches about problem solving (algorithmic thinking)
* It's cross-curricular (solve math problems or create an art project)
* It generates early interest in Computer Science
* It stimulates design & creativity
* It strengthens math skills

## Why Python?
Python is a fully featured modern programming language that places an emphasis on writing code that is easy to read.  As such, it has gained a strong following in educational circles as a first language for computer science courses.

A summary of Python's benefits:
* It's Multi-platform - runs on all popular computing platforms.
    * If you're running Linux or OS X it's already installed!
* It has wide global industry support.
    * Python is used at YouTube, NASA, Google, and many more large organizations you've heard of.
* Clean and simple syntax
    * Python programs are easy to read.  Compare the following:
    * This lets students focus on learning skills (decomposition, algorithms) without struggling with complicated syntax.
* General purpose - it can be applied to many different types of problems, from science to math to gaming and graphics.
* Because of this, many colleges, such as MIT and , have adopted Python for their introductory computer science classes.

## Why Raspberry Pi?
The [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) is a credit-card sized computer developed to promote teaching of computer science in schools.  Since its launch in 2012, over 1 million of these amazing little machines have been sold all over the world.  It includes an interface for talking to external analog/digital electronics, so it also makes a great platform for DIY projects.



The Raspberry Pi ships with Scratch and Python already configured, so it's ready to go out of the box - just plug in a monitor and keyboard/mouse!

Here are a few examples of projects kids have made with a Pi:
* Programming
* Web development
* Electronics
* Robotics
* Automation/Sensing
