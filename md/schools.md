We offer a variety of ways to enhance the technology education at your school while providing a safe, fun environment for learning:
- After school programs
- In-class sessions
- Weekend workshops

We have coordinated with educators to ensure our subject matter and examples reinforce California Common Core standards appropriate to your child's grade level.  Additionally, we can work with your teachers to customize the classes to support their current lessons and classroom activities.

Our school programs can be hosted on your school's campus in a dedicated classroom - even if you don't have a computer lab!
